## This launch script was automatically generated by 'x9dotnet_publish' on 20200930-123443.
## The purpose is to keep whatever folder this executable will reside in, reasonably clutter-free.
## The platform-independent CLR program this script runs, requires several runtime-related files to
##     be in the same directory.
## The executable relies on the 'netcoreapp3.1' runtime to be installed on the host.
## Since it is platform-independent, a Windows .cmd script is also created, but only the appropriate
##     one needs to be copied to the target platform. (Bash script for Linux/MacOS, CMD for Windows.)
